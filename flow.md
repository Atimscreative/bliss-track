# BlissTrack - Business Management Web App

## Business Name: Oluwaseyi Bliss Beddings

## Problem Statement

### Original:
"I want to build a web app for my mom to help her small-scale business in order to track her expenses for bedsheet material, packaging material, transportation. Tracking pricing of different sizes, sales, expenses, profit, loss, quantity of bedsheets in stock, quantity of packaging materials left, etc."

### Modified:
"Develop a web application for my small-scale bedsheet business. The application should enable efficient management and tracking of key business operations, including:

- **Expense Tracking:** Recording and categorizing expenses related to bedsheet materials, packaging, and transportation.
- **Inventory Management:** Monitoring the quantity of bedsheets in stock and the remaining packaging materials.
- **Pricing Management:** Managing the pricing of bedsheets based on different sizes.
- **Sales Tracking:** Recording and tracking sales transactions.
- **Financial Analysis:** Calculating profit and loss per production cycle, providing insights into the financial performance of the business."

## Considerations
1. The business owner is not highly tech-savvy and prefers a **warm, cool color theme** for better readability.
2. Needs a **simple and intuitive user interface** for ease of use.
